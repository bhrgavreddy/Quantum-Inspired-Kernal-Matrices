Classical Feature Map for Quantum-Inspired Machine Learning

Author: Dr. techn Sebastian Raubitzek MSc. BSc.

This class, `ClassicalFeatureMap`, implements classical simulations of quantum feature maps, specifically designed for quantum-inspired kernel matrix computation in machine learning. The feature maps follow the principles of quantum computing, including the use of Pauli matrices, Hadamard gates, and phase rotations to encode classical data into simulated quantum states.

### Key Components:
1. **Pauli Matrices**:
   - The class uses the Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, and Pauli-Z matrices (`sigma_x`, `sigma_y`, `sigma_z`) to simulate the fundamental quantum operations that act on qubits in the feature map.

2. **Hadamard Gate**:
   - A Hadamard gate is applied to each qubit to place it into a superposition state, which is a key step in encoding classical data into quantum states.

3. **Quantum Feature Map**:
   - The class supports applying various quantum-inspired feature maps to input data:
     - **Z Feature Map**: Applies Hadamard gates followed by U1 phase rotations to encode classical data into the quantum state through phase modulation. This feature map simulates how a quantum system would transform classical input data.
     - Future extensions of the class could include other feature maps, such as the `ZZ` map.

### Methods:
- **`apply_feature_map(self, X, feature_map_name)`**:
   - Applies the specified quantum feature map to an input vector `X`. Currently, only the 'Z' feature map is implemented. Future feature maps can be added.
   - Parameters:
     - `X` (numpy.ndarray): A vector of real numbers to be transformed.
     - `feature_map_name` (str): The name of the feature map ('Z' is the only option implemented).
   - Returns:
     - A complex vector representing the quantum state after applying the feature map.

- **`z_feature_map(self, X)`**:
   - Implements the Z feature map by applying Hadamard gates to create a superposition and encoding the input data into phase rotations. The method captures the principles of quantum superposition and phase encoding to represent classical data as quantum information.
   - Parameters:
     - `X` (numpy.ndarray): A vector of real numbers representing classical data.
   - Returns:
     - A complex vector representing the final quantum state after applying the Z feature map.
   - Example Usage:
     ```python
     feature_map = ClassicalFeatureMap()
     data_vector = np.array([0.5, -1.3, 2.4])
     quantum_state = feature_map.z_feature_map(data_vector)
     print("Simulated Quantum State:", quantum_state)
     ```

### Quantum Feature Map Explanation:
- **Z Feature Map**:
   - The Z feature map applies a Hadamard gate to each qubit, placing it into superposition. Then, it applies phase rotations (U1 gates) based on the input data. This process encodes classical information into the quantum state by adjusting the phase of each qubit, simulating how classical data would be transformed in a quantum computer.
   - In a practical quantum computing scenario, these operations would correspond to encoding classical data into quantum circuits for use in algorithms like quantum support vector machines or quantum kernel estimation.

### Context and Purpose:
- This class provides the foundation for simulating quantum feature maps in classical machine learning models, allowing researchers to explore how quantum principles like superposition and phase encoding could be used to enhance data transformation and model performance.
- It serves as a simulation tool for understanding quantum-inspired machine learning methods discussed in the paper "Quantum-inspired Kernel Matrices: Exploring Symmetry in Machine Learning" (Raubitzek et al., 2024), where quantum kernel estimators based on symmetry group transformations are explored.

### Notes:
- This implementation simulates the behavior of quantum circuits in a classical environment. It can be extended to support more complex feature maps (e.g., entanglement operations with the ZZ feature map).
- The current implementation does not perform actual quantum computation but instead mimics the behavior of quantum gates for the purpose of classical machine learning research.

        Implements the Z feature map by applying a sequence of Hadamard gates followed by U1 phase rotations
        based on the input features. This feature map applies the phase rotations without entangling gates,

        The process involves applying a Hadamard gate to each qubit to create a superposition, followed by
        a U1 phase rotation gate that encodes the feature data into the phase of the qubit. This sequence

        X (numpy.ndarray): A vector of real numbers representing classical data. Each element in X corresponds
                           to a feature to be encoded into the quantum state by a qubit.
